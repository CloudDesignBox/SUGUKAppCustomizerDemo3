## sugukdemo-3

This is a demo of application customizers for SUGUK Leeds. In this example, we:
<ul>
<li>add HTML and CSS to the Top zone of the modern SharePoint pages</li>
<li>Add the time and date using a JavaScript function</li>
<li>Import jQuery and jQuery Cycle 2 using CDNs</li>
<li>Use the REST API to get announcements and display them in a slideshow</li>
<li>Add Google Analytics to the page</li>
  </ul>
