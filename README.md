This is a demo of application customizers for SUGUK Leeds. In this example, we:
<p>add HTML and CSS to the Top zone of the modern SharePoint pages</p>
<p>Add the time and date using a JavaScript function</p>
<p>Import jQuery and jQuery Cycle 2 using CDNs</p>
<p>Use the REST API to get announcements and display them in a slideshow</p>
<p>Add Google Analytics to the page</p>
